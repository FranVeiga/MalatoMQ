# MalatoMQ (WIP)

MalatoMQ is a simple message queue written in Go. It aims to be
lightweight and efficient, using ProtoBufs for client-server communication,
and SQLite for message persistency.

So far I'm taking this on as a personal project, but of course
any feedback is well received. This is my first Go project, so
surely there will be many things to improve! I'm open to any
kind of suggestions.
